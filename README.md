### **Introduction**

Terrorism poses a persistent global threat, with profound repercussions that extend beyond national borders. In particular, Somalia has emerged as a critical focal point for terrorist activity, primarily driven by the al-Shabaab insurgent group. This organization has launched numerous attacks against civilians, government institutions, and international entities, exacerbating the country's longstanding security challenges.

As Africa grapples with a surge in terrorist incidents, understanding the specific dynamics at play in Somalia is paramount. This project analyzes data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to uncover the frequency, patterns, and underlying motivations of terrorism in Somalia. By examining key variables—such as attack types, methods, geographic distribution, and target demographics—we aim to highlight critical trends that inform effective counterterrorism strategies. Ultimately, this research seeks to contribute to enhancing stability and security in a nation profoundly impacted by violence.
